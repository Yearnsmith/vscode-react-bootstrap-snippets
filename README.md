## 📖 Snippets

**All snippets start with `rb` (for React-Bootstrap).**

There are over 350 snippets available for components, imports, and examples. Read more on each below.

### Component Snippets

All of React-Bootstrap's components are supported.

For example, `rb:alert`, `rb:badge`, `rb:breadrcumb`, etc.

Where applicable, suggestions are made for which components to use inside a given component, such as `thead` and `tbody` inside a `Table`.

### Import Snippets

Component import snippets are available for all React-Bootstrap components. 

All imports begin with `rb:import` followed by the component name. For example, `rb:import:row` will import `Row`. 

You can also use `rb:import:grid` to import `Container`, `Row`, and `Col` all at once.

### Example Snippets

Where applicable, examples from the docs are provided as snippets. These can be very helpful as a starting point when working with more complex components, or for use as quick placeholders.

Example snippets all end with `-example`. 

For instance, `rb:alert-example` will insert an example `Alert` to build upon.
