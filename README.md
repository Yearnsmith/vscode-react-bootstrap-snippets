## ðŸ“– Snippets

All React-Bootstrap snippets begin with `rb`.

Type `rb` and press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Space</kbd> for autocompletion.

There are over 350 snippets available for components, imports, and examples. Read more on each below.

> Note: Due to the sheer number of snippets available, they are not abbreviated as you might see in other snippets extensions. VS Code's intelligent search usually autocompletes to the component you're looking for, making it a pleasure to work with in most cases.

### Component Snippets

All of React-Bootstrap's components are supported.

For example, `rb:alert`, `rb:badge`, `rb:breadrcumb`, etc.

### Import Snippets

Component import snippets are available for all React-Bootstrap components. 

All imports begin with `rb:import` followed by the component name. For example, `rb:import:row` will import `Row`. 

You can also use `rb:import:grid` to import `Container`, `Row`, and `Col` all in one go.
### Example Snippets

Where applicable, examples from the docs are provided as snippets. These can be very helpful as a starting point when working with more complex components, or for use as quick placeholders.

Example snippets all end with `-example`. 

For instance, `rb:alert-example` will insert an example `Alert` to build upon.
